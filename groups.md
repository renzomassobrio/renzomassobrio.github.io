I work as a teaching and research assistant at the Department of Transport. We are a small group of young researchers with different academic backgrounds. Our main interests include the analysis of public transport and socioeconomical data to evaluate QoS offered to citizens by the public transport system.

## GOAL 
**Group on Optimization And Learning, Universidad de Cádiz, Spain** 

[Group website](http://goal.uca.es)

The GOAL research group, standing for Group on Optimization And Learning focusses on the design of innovative methods for artificial intelligence and their application to complex real world problems. Our activity is currently mainly focussed on optimization (continuous, combinatorial, dynamic and static, single- and multi-objective, exact algorithms, metaheuristics, parallelism,..), machine learning (SVMs, deep learning, neural networks, regression techniques), sustainable computing (autonomous programming, automatic generation of energy-efficient SW, efficient resources management), and intelligent transportation systems.
